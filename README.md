This repo is a simple machine learning project that builds a Random Forest classifier to predict survival on the Titanic dataset. 
I aimed to understand both the fundamentals and deeper workings of the Random Forest classifier, with the goal of applying this knowledge to develop practical, real-world models for business applications.

#Project Structure:
├── titanic_model.ipynb      # Main Jupyter notebook with all code
├── train (1).csv            # Training data
├── test (1).csv             # Test data
├── gender_submission.csv    # Sample submission file
└── submission.csv           # Model predictions for submission

#Key Highlights:
1. Baseline model with 5 simple features
2. Feature engineering: FamilySize, IsAlone, Title
3. Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
4. Random Forest visualization using plot_tree
5. Test set prediction + submission file creation

#Decision Tree Visualization
